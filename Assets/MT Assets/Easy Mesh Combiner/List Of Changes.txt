/////////////////////

v2.4.2
	- A bug has been fixed that caused the automatic deactivation of some scripts' Gizmos to stop working.
	- Fixed a bug where changing Easy Mesh Combiner UI parameters did not work on some versions
	  of Unity 2019.3.x.

v2.4.1
	- Combined Meshes Manager is now not displayed in the component list.
	- Now the Gizmos of the RuntimeMeshCombiner and other components are no longer displayed.
	- Now, by default, the option to launch debug logs on the console, is enabled so that in case of any
	  runtime merging error, you know. You can always disable it if you prefer!
	- The documentation has been updated to ensure greater clarity, volume of information, tips and minor corrections!
	- Fixed a bug in the creation of prefabs, which affected versions newer to Unity 2018.3.
	- Now the meshes that are disabled, will not be included in the run-time merges, even if they are in the list
	  to merge.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner will no longer issue merge warnings about possible problems with Lightmaps, if you 
	  have not checked the support option for Lightmaps.

v2.4.0
	- Following the rhythm of Unity Engine versions and to guarantee the good permanent support of this asset,
	  now the minimum recommended version is 2018.1, however, you can still use this asset in the 2017.4 LTS
	  version if you prefer. This will allow this asset to always have the latest features and better and
	  more effective support!
	- Fixed a bug that caused the merging of very large meshes to suffer from distortions in the 2018.1
	  version of Unity.
	- Fixed a bug that caused GameObjects to be active, but with MeshFilters disabled, also be combined
	  while selecting all meshes or a GameObject that contains all meshes in the scenario.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner is now able to give an automatic name to the prefab you want to save.
	- To avoid problems, Easy Mesh Combiner will now only display the combined mesh management buttons,
	  in the original meshes and no longer in their respective prefabs.
	- The combined mesh manager interface has undergone some changes for clarity. Now the selection of
	  meshes combined by materials has a scrollview to make things more organized.

v2.3.0
	- In this version, some unused files have been removed from the package. For example, the demo scene
	  materials now use standard Unity shaders. Nothing that will affect the way the EMC works.
	- All resources, persistent asset data and other files are now saved in "MT Assets/_AssetsData".
	  This makes it easy to manage all files generated by MT assets and if you need to remove any asset,
	  just delete the asset folder. So, even if you want to remove some MT assets from your project, or
	  update it, you will not lose any files or information that you would like to keep!

v2.2.1
	- Fixed a bug that caused the compilation or loading time of the scene execution to increase considerably
	  in the editor.

v2.2.0
	- Now you no longer need to check the option of more than 64,000 vertices to combine giant meshes.
	  Easy Mesh Combiner can automatically identify the size of the meshes and will select whether the
	  resulting mesh will be 16 bits or 32 bits.

v2.1.1
	- Fixed a compatibility issue with Unity version 2018.1.

v2.1.0
	- This major update has brought several enhancements, feature additions, and enhancements to EMC's workflow!
	- This update may cause your combined mesh managers of version 1.7.1 or lower to stop working as they
	  should. Back up your project to revert changes if you prefer. The new combined mesh manager is
	  better and smarter, read on.
	- Minor additions to the asset menu.
	- Improvement of some asset codes.
	- Improvements to undo actions.
	- Updated UI! Easy Mesh Combiner is now more intuitive and optimized for use in the Editor!
	- Improvements in displaying merge statistics.
	- Added merge log. Through it, you can identify problems in meshes before you merge, and also get
	  the root of what is causing the problem.
	- All EMC source code has been rewritten, optimized and revamped!
	- Easy Mesh Combiner will now keep your merge preferences even if you close the editor window.
	- Now the merge window continues to update even while it is not in focus. So you can select meshes
	  while everything is updated automatically!
	- Now the Easy Mesh Combiner window will remember which position you left it when you closed it.
	- Valid GameObjects selected for merge will now be highlighted in blue. Invalid GameObjects will
	  be highlighted in red in your scene. (Highlights only appear with the merge window open).
	- The option to add a comment to the GameObject resulting from the merge has been removed,
	  however, you can now choose the name of this GameObject before merging.
	- Easy Mesh Combiner should now work smoothly on versions older than 2017.4, but mesh support
	  with more than 65,000 vertices will not work on versions older than 2017.4.
	- Now, when you finish a merge, only 1 new GameObject will be generated that will contain a
	  single mesh resulting from the merge!
	- The resulting GameObject merge will now be positioned as close as possible to the selected
	  GameObjects to be merged into the hierarchy. The resulting GameObject from the merge will no
	  longer appear at the end of your scene hierarchy.
	- Several improvements made to the combined mesh manager. You now have better mesh management after the merge.
	- Fixed a bug where previously disabled meshes are enabled when undoing a merge!
	- Fixed a bug when importing this asset for the first time, where a file error message was displayed.
	  It was more common with Windows 10 users.
	- Several interface improvements.
	- Fixing a bug that caused Unity to crash (in some versions) upon completion of a merge.
	- Documentation updated.
	- Added a feature so you can merge and unmerge at runtime, so you can optimize your game even
	  as it runs, quickly and optimally!
	- Added new sample scene to show merge at runtime.
	- You can have a complete debug of the merge process at run time.
	- Fixed a compatibility issue with prefab creation in the latest versions of Unity.
	- The management of combined mesh prefabs has also been improved.
	- Better organization of source code.
	- There was a slight change in the asset API. Now, to access the API methods of this
	  asset, use "using MTAssets.EasyMeshCombiner".
	- Added function to select all original GameObjects containing X material in combined mesh
	  manager (after merging using Editor).

v1.4
	- The minimum support version is now Unity 2018.1.0f2. This change was made to ensure future improvements to the tool! Stay tuned!
	- The 65,000 vertices limit has been removed! Now you can combine your knits without worrying about this limitation!
	- Now the tool interface shows the information you are merging.

	- Addition of explanations on the merge of meshes and generation of lightmaps in the documentation.

	- Do not worry about duplicates when saving the meshes combined in your project file!
	- If you have saved the merge files in your project files, and you want to undo the merge,
	  all unnecessary files are also deleted from your project. So you do not worry about memory problems!
	- The combined mesh manager now shows you a warning if it detects that one of the meshes combined
	  does not have any important files.
	- The documentation has been contemplated with the new details!
